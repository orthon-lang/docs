# AGENTS.md — Agent Guide for Orthon

> Instructions for AI agents contributing to the Orthon language design project.

---

## 1. Project Identity

Orthon is a **programming language design project**. This repository contains *only* design documentation — no implementation code, no build system, no runtime. The entire project exists in the `docs/` directory.

The language is designed using the same SOLID engineering principles it encourages in its users: a small, orthogonal core with layered abstraction, explicit semantics, and implementation-independent evolution.

> **⚠ Language Rule:** All project content, code snippets, comments, commit messages, and agent reasoning MUST be in English. See §10.9 for full enforcement.

---

## 2. Documentation Framework

All documentation follows the **Why → How → What** (Golden Circle) framework:

| Layer | Question | Documents |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Why** | Why does Orthon exist? What do we believe? What are we trying to achieve? | `why/VISION.md`, `why/MANIFESTO.md`, `why/ZEN.md`, `why/GOALS.md` |
| **How** | How is Orthon designed and structured? | `how/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, `how/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `how/strategies/IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGIES.md`, `how/IMPLEMENTATION_POLICIES.md` |
| **What** | What is Orthon concretely? | `what/CORE_CONCEPTS.md` (accepted concept registry — currently empty), `how/concepts/research/` (in-progress research) |
| **How** | How are concepts designed? | `how/concepts/research/` (research inbox), `how/concepts/README.md` (pipeline) |

An agent must **always** anchor new content to the correct layer. A "Why" argument must not be smuggled into a "What" document. If a new piece of documentation spans layers, split it or add cross-references.

## 4. Language & Style

### 4.1 Tone

- **Precise** over poetic. Avoid metaphor where direct language suffices.
- **Concise** over verbose. Prefer a short sentence to a long paragraph.
- **Authoritative** over speculative. Design documents state decisions, not opinions.
- **Consistent** terminology (see §6 Terminology).

### 4.2 Code Examples

Every code example in documentation should:

1. Be syntactically valid Orthon (or clearly marked as pseudocode).
2. Demonstrate exactly one concept.
3. Include **all canonical forms** when documenting a feature (see the *Show All Canonical Forms* principle in `how/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`).
4. Precede semantic explanation rather than follow it.

### 4.4 Document Naming Conventions

All files in `docs/` follow a consistent naming pattern:

| Convention | Rule | Examples |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Content documents** | UPPER_CASE, single topic per file | `VISION.md`, `CORE_CONCEPTS.md`, `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` |
| **Category directories** | Lowercase, plural | `why/`, `what/`, `how/`, `when/`, `decision_records/`, `templates/`, `gates/` |
| **Fill-in templates** | `_` prefix + kebab-case inside `templates/` | `how/templates/_edr.md`, `how/templates/_design-review.md` |
| **Gate checklists** | `_` prefix + kebab-case inside `gates/` | `how/gates/_language-design.md` |
| **EDR records** | `EDR-NNN-title-with-dashes.md` inside `decision_records/{category}/` | `how/decision_records/architecture/EDR-042-event-sourcing.md` |
| **Glossary / reference** | UPPER_CASE, `GLOSSARY.md` | `what/GLOSSARY.md` |

**Rules:**

1. **Content docs** live inside their layer directory (`why/`, `what/`, `how/`), use `UPPER_CASE.md`.
2. **`AGENTS.md`** stays at `docs/` root as the single entry-point for agent instructions.
3. **Templates** (fill-in forms) use the `_` prefix so they sort first in directory listings. Place them inside `how/templates/`.
4. **Category directories** (`why/`, `what/`, `how/`, `when/`, `decision_records/`, `templates/`, `gates/`) are lowercase, plural nouns.
5. **Actual records** (filled-in EDRs, completed gates) drop the `_` prefix — they are content, not forms.
6. **Do not nest directories deeper than `docs/{layer}/{category}/`** unless explicitly justified.
7. **When adding a new document type**, create a matching category directory and template, then update this section and §3 Document Map.

---

## 5. Agent Workflow

When assigned a task in this project, follow this protocol:

### 5.1 Orient

1. **Assert language.** Before any other step, assert: *"All content I produce will be in English."* If the user's request is in another language, silently translate your output. The project language is English (§10.9).
2. **Read the relevant layer first.** If the task is about a concrete feature, start with `how/concepts/research/` (concept research). `what/CORE_CONCEPTS.md` is the acceptance destination but is currently empty — no concepts have been accepted yet. If it is about a principle decision, start with `why/VISION.md` and `how/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`.
3. **Check cross-references.** A design decision in one document may affect documents in other layers.
4. **Run the Decision Pipeline** (`how/process/DECISION_PIPELINE.md`) before designing any new feature — 10 questions determine whether the feature should exist and at what level.
5. **Check `how/gates/_language-design.md`** if the task involves making a design decision — the gate defines the acceptance criteria.

### 5.2 Design

1. **Start from first principles.** Anchor every proposal in the project's existing philosophy. If a proposal contradicts `why/MANIFESTO.md` or `why/ZEN.md`, the proposal must either be rejected or the philosophy documents must be updated (and the change must be intentional, not accidental).
2. **Favor minimal additions.** Ask: *"Can this be expressed through composition of existing concepts?"* before introducing a new concept.
3. **Prefer named over symbolic.** If adding an operator, also define its named function equivalent.
4. **Document alternatives.** When proposing a design choice, briefly note what was considered and why it was rejected.
5. **Preserve orthogonality.** Every new construct must combine freely with existing constructs. No special cases.

### 5.3 Gate

Before finalizing any new or modified design document:

1. **Verify language compliance.** Scan every string of new or modified text. If any content is not in English, translate it before proceeding.
2. **Verify against the `how/gates/_language-design.md`** checklist. If the gate does not exist yet or is empty, propose a gate entry for the decision.

### 5.4 Write

1. Place the document in the correct `docs/` location.
2. Follow the document's existing structure and heading style.
3. Use Markdown (`*.md`).
4. Write in English (see §10.9).
5. Use fenced code blocks with `orthon` as the language tag for Orthon code.
6. Use `text` for non-Orthon structural diagrams.
7. Keep table of contents in sync if the document uses one.

---

## 6. Terminology (Ubiquitous Language)

All project terminology is defined in [`what/GLOSSARY.md`](what/GLOSSARY.md).

Use terms **consistently** and **always** in their defined meaning. When introducing a new term, add it to `what/GLOSSARY.md` and cross-reference the source document.

Key terms every agent must know:

- **Data** — the primary abstraction; values without imposed semantic meaning.
- **Data Modifier** — transforms data between representations.
- **Representation** — a specific view of data (Value, Tuple, Reference, Sequence, Set, Option, Result).
- **Sequence** — values produced over time; describes *what*, not *how*.
- **Orthogonality** — each construct solves one problem and combines freely.

→ See [`what/GLOSSARY.md`](what/GLOSSARY.md) for the complete reference with cross-document links.

---

## 7. Design Decision Protocol

Every design decision follows the **Decision Process** defined in
[`how/process/DECISION_PROCESS.md`](how/process/DECISION_PROCESS.md).
Before detailed design, run through the **Decision Pipeline** in
[`how/process/DECISION_PIPELINE.md`](how/process/DECISION_PIPELINE.md)
to determine whether the feature should exist and at what level.

Substantive design decisions must be recorded. Use one of these mechanisms, ordered by increasing formality:

### 7.1 Inline (for small decisions)

Add a note at the end of the relevant section:

```markdown
> **Decision:** Tuples are immutable by default.
> **Rationale:** Consistency with the data-first model — data does not mutate.
> **Alternatives considered:** Mutable tuples rejected because they conflate identity with value.
```

### 7.2 Gate Entry (for decisions that need review)

If the decision is significant enough to warrant a review pass, add an entry to `how/gates/_language-design.md`:

```markdown
### Gate 003: Sequence Emission Syntax

**Status:** Pending

**Criteria:**
- [ ] `emit` keyword semantics are defined.
- [ ] `return sequence(...)` equivalence is documented.
- [ ] `->` operator equivalence is documented.
- [ ] All three forms compile to the same semantics.
```

### 7.3 EDR (for consequential engineering decisions)

For decisions with long-lasting impact — architectural choices, principle changes,
process decisions, or trade-offs that affect multiple documents — create an
Engineering Decision Record in `docs/how/decision_records/{category}/`.

Use the base template at [`docs/how/templates/_edr.md`](../how/templates/_edr.md)
or a category-specific template (`_edr-architecture.md`, `_edr-process.md`).
Name the file `EDR-NNN-title-with-dashes.md` where `NNN` is the next sequential
number (see [`decision_records/INDEX.md`](../how/decision_records/INDEX.md)).

EDRs are appropriate when:
- The decision affects how future design work is evaluated.
- The rationale needs to be *findable* years later.
- The decision supersedes or deprecates a previous EDR.

---

## 8. Proposal Structure

When proposing a new language feature or design change, structure the proposal as follows:

```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

### Layer
Why / How / What

### Problem
What gap or inconsistency does this address?

### Proposal
The concrete design.

### Canonical Forms
All equivalent ways to express the feature.

### Interaction with Existing Concepts
How this composes with Data, Data Modifiers, Sequence, etc.

### Alternatives Considered
What was rejected and why.

### Impact on Existing Documents
Which docs need updating.

### Gate Criteria
Checklist for `how/gates/_language-design.md`.
```

For proposals that warrant formal peer review, use the template at [`docs/how/templates/_design-review.md`](../how/templates/_design-review.md).

---

## 9. Review Checklist

Before finalizing any document or proposal, verify against this checklist. For formal peer reviews, use the full template at [`docs/how/templates/_design-review.md`](../how/templates/_design-review.md).

- [ ] **Consistency:** Does this align with `why/MANIFESTO.md` and `how/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`?
- [ ] **Orthogonality:** Does this combine freely with existing constructs?
- [ ] **Minimality:** Is this adding a new concept when composition would suffice?
- [ ] **Explicitness:** Are semantic changes syntactically visible?
- [ ] **EDR:** Does this decision warrant an EDR in `docs/how/decision_records/`?
- [ ] **All canonical forms:** Are all equivalent forms documented?
- [ ] **English (MANDATORY):** Scan every string of text — headings, body, code comments, captions, table cells. Is every single one in English? If any non-English text exists, this check FAILS. Do not mark pass until all text is English.
- [ ] **Terminology:** Are project terms used consistently with [`what/GLOSSARY.md`](what/GLOSSARY.md)?
- [ ] **Gate:** Does the decision have a gate entry if needed?
- [ ] **EDR:** Does this decision warrant an EDR in `docs/how/decision_records/`?
- [ ] **Cross-references:** Are related documents linked?

---

## 10. AI Agent Constraints

Agents operating in this repository must follow these rules:

1. **Read first.** Never propose a change without reading the existing document(s) that the change affects.
2. **No code generation.** This is a design-only repository. Do not generate compiler, runtime, or tooling implementation code. Code snippets in documentation are for illustration only.
3. **No external dependencies.** Do not introduce dependencies on external frameworks, tools, or standards unless explicitly justified in the proposal.
4. **Preserve document structure.** Do not rearrange `docs/` hierarchy without updating `AGENTS.md` and cross-references.
5. **One intention per commit.** When making changes, group edits by topic, not by file.
6. **Gate before merge.** Any design decision must pass the gate before being considered final.
7. **When in doubt, reference `why/ZEN.md`.** The Zen aphorisms are the shortest path to a guiding principle.
8. **Verify paths.** Every cross-reference (link) added or modified in a
   document must resolve to an existing file in the repository, relative
   to the source document's location. This applies to all referenced
   files — concept docs, gate checklists, strategies, ADRs, templates,
   and any other path — not only those under `what/concepts/`.
   Additionally, cross-references to documents under `what/concepts/`
   must use the `concepts/` prefix (e.g., `concepts/CORE_CONCEPTS.md`,
   not `CORE_CONCEPTS.md`), as these files reside in a subdirectory and
   bare filenames would not resolve. The same rule applies to
   `how/concepts/research/` — use the full relative path from the
   source document.
9. **English at all times.** All documentation, code snippets, comments, commit messages,
   agent reasoning, and any generated text MUST be written in **English**. This is a
   non-negotiable project rule.

   **Enforcement:** Before creating or modifying any file, the agent MUST confirm that
   every string of text to be written is in English. Any content found in another
   language must be translated before writing. This rule takes precedence over the
   user's request language — if the user writes in another language, the agent
   translates the response to English.
10. **Commit message prefixes.** Every commit message MUST use a conventional prefix
    to indicate the type of change. Use one of:

    | Prefix | When to use |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `docs:` | Documentation-only changes (concept docs, spec, research) |
    | `feat:` | New language feature or concept |
    | `fix:`  | Correction of an error in existing documentation |
    | `chore:` | Maintenance tasks (templates, config, tooling) |
    | `refactor:` | Restructuring without semantic change |
    | `meta:` | Changes to agent instructions or process docs |

    **Format:** `prefix: short description`

    ```
    docs: add gradual typing concept research document
    chore: update EDR template with new fields
    ```

    The body may contain additional detail after a blank line. Multiple
    changes in the same commit should share the same prefix; if they do
    not, prefer separate commits.
